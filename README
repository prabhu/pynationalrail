pynationalrail is a python implementation of the national rail api. 

Plus it also includes a django based webapp (myrail) to showcase the power of the api. The app uses jqtouch and hence is optimised for modern smartphones.

Usage
------
To use the api, you need to know the three character station code or CRS code. Current list of CRS codes can be found in 
http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/codes/

from nationalrail import nationalrail

rail = nationalrail()
print rail.departures(crs="PAD", filterCrs="STL")
print rail.arrivals(crs="HAY")
print rail.arrivalsAndDeparture(crs="PAD")

Django app

myrail app can be run just like any other django apps.
